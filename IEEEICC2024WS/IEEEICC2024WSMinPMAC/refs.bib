abstract = {For the last few decades, wireless communication has been facing a technological revolution. High data rate and continuous connectivity are the necessities because the technology has turned from simple voice communication to newly high interactive multimedia applications. Also, the demands for mobile devices are growing tremendously. Researchers are developing fifth-generation (5G) and beyond fifth-generation (B5G) wireless communication networks to fulfill the needs in the future. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) can be a promising scheme to meet the demands of an enormously growing number of users, connectivity requirements, low-cost requirements, limited bandwidth requirements, and high coverage requirements for future wireless communication networks. NOMA-assisted wireless communication networks have to face several challenges along with several benefits. In the previous survey papers, the main focus of the researchers was on the concepts of NOMA, its comparison with other techniques, and issues related to NOMA. This paper presents a thorough survey on NOMA and future 5G and B5G wireless communication networks. We have arranged the paper in such a way that conveys all the aspects of 5G and B5G networks and NOMA’s application in 5G and B5G. This paper includes the study of existing survey papers, comparison with our paper, our contribution, uniqueness, and benefits of our paper. It includes requirements and technologies for 5G and B5G, channel modeling, the role of NOMA in 5G and B5G, types of NOMA, NOMA’s network architecture, mobility management (MM) in NOMA, asynchronous and synchronous operations in NOMA, energy and green aspects of NOMA in 5G and B5G, NOMA’s challenges, solutions to these challenges, NOMA’s performance indicators. This paper also includes the problems of resource allocation in 5G and B5G, role of NOMA in improving resource allocation and future research directions for next-generation wireless communication networks. This paper also discusses cloud virtualization (CV), fog networking (FN), and edge networking (EN), enterprise and industry 4.0 perspectives, the importance of standardization of NOMA, third generation partnership project (3GPP) standards for NOMA. This paper also highlights the security, blockchain aspects, practicality, and industry acceptance for NOMA in 5G and B5G.}
